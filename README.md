Description

This is a school project that target the usage of db and php, this is the first 'big' procject i am  doing in school.
It let a user choose products from a database. A random user can create an account and connect in the website.
Each connected user can add products to it, they can also put a star to a product to put it in the 'fav' folder, so they can refind it later without scrolling the whole website again.
There is also a chat to talk with the seller of an item.


Installation

Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

Project status

I am actually working on the project.
