Description

This is a school project that target the usage of db and php, this is the first 'big' procject i am  doing in school.
It let a user choose products from a database. A random user can create an account and connect in the website.
Each connected user can add products to it, they can also put a star to a product to put it in the 'fav' folder, so they can refind it later without scrolling the whole website again.
There is also a chat to talk with the seller of an item.
